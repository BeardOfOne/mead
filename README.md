### Version 2.0.0 (In Progress)

A brand new version that will be stamped as 2.0.0 is currently being worked on, and there will be a brand new game that we will be making using the editor portion of this framework. I am working hard on testing out the editor and adding in what needs to be added to be able to support MonoGame for an unannounced PC game that will be released on Steam, the goal is to code up a tech demo and prototype first, and from there polish off a demo that we can put onto the store this year. From there I will collect feedback and use that to make the rest of the game.


### Version 1.3

This framework has provided support for the below listed games. Newer version have undergone lots of code cleanup and contract modification that will break parts of the game if used. I dont mind releasing minor patches for 1.3 so just send me an email with the issue and I'll make sure to get on that.
